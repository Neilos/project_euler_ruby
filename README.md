About Project Euler
-------------------

[http://projecteuler.net/][http://projecteuler.net/]

"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems..."


Me and Project Euler
--------------------

While learning the Ruby programming language I am using the problems posed on Project Euler to hone my skills as a software developer and Rubyist.

My solutions to the problems posed by Project Euler are contained within this repository. Each problem is contained in its own directory which contains a README file outlining the problem, class files, an executable (name preceded with exec) and test files.
